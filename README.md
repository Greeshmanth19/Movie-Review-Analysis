# Movie-Review-Analysis

- Model Used -> Logistic Regression, Bag of Words model, NLP( Natural Language Processing ) for review analysis
- DataSet -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ITBaF4OmnzI7IaNMOVs4fZQRAwhrfoa5/view?usp=sharing
- Data preview -> dataset contains 25000 unique movie reviews with are labeled with 0 (negative review) and 1 (positive review)
- Accuracy gained -> 86 %

- Aim :
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the Bag of Words model. The goal is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed in the text.

- Introduction :
Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding people's opinions and attitudes toward a particular subject. In this project, we leverage NLP techniques and the Bag of Words model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. By using machine learning algorithms, we can analyze a large number of reviews and gain valuable insights.

- Installation :
To set up the project, follow these steps:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Greeshmanth19/Movie-Review-Analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd Movie-Review-Analysis.git

- Dataset :
The dataset used in this project contains a collection of movie reviews labeled as positive as 1 or negative as 0. I provided a google drive link of the dataset that I have used in this project it contains 25000 unique reviews. Feel free to replace it with your own dataset for analysis.

- Bag of Words Model :
The Bag of Words model is a simple and effective technique for text representation. It represents a piece of text as a bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping track of word frequency. The Bag of Words model provides a foundation for feature extraction in NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis.

- NLP Techniques :
The project employs various NLP techniques to preprocess and analyze movie reviews. Some of the techniques used include tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, and vectorization. These techniques help transform the raw text into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

- Results :
After training the model on the movie review dataset, the project provides performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics help assess the model's ability to classify movie reviews correctly. In this project, i implemented a logistic regression classification model for making predictions.
